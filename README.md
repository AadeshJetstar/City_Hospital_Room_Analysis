# City_Hospital_Room_Analysis
ðŸš‘ City Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard  Recently, I had the opportunity to learn Interactive Dashboard Design from Satish Dhawale Sir, and I applied those skills to create this Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard.

This dashboard helps in understanding and analyzing the emergency room data in a meaningful way:

âœ… Patient Admission Status â€“ Tracks admitted vs. not admitted patients.
âœ… Age Group Distribution â€“ Shows patient visits across different age groups.
âœ… Timeliness â€“ Measures how many patients were attended to on time (within 30 minutes).
âœ… Gender Analysis â€“ Breaks down patients by male vs. female ratio.
âœ… Department Referrals â€“ Highlights which departments receive the most referrals.

ðŸ“Š With this, we can quickly identify:

Efficiency in patient handling.

Peak age groups visiting ER.

Referral patterns to departments.

Satisfaction levels and average wait time.

Learning this skill has given me a deeper understanding of how data can drive decision-making in healthcare and help improve operational efficiency.

Big thanks to Satish Dhawale Sir for guiding me through this learning journey! ðŸ™Œ
